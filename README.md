### 📂 **My Projects**
Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on so far:
1. **Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model**  
   - Goal is to develop regression models to analyze relationships between health insurance costs and key factors such as age, smoking status, and BMI, using statistical testing and data visualization to draw insights
   - Currently learning basics of supervised machine learning techniques and implementing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection 
   - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
   - Performed statistical analysis to identify key risk factors affecting health insurance costs and enhance predictive accuracy
   - [View Project](https://github.com/ntc03/Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Model)

2. **Python GUI Insurance Pricing Calculator**  
   - Interactive user interface using Tkinter to calculate insurance premiums based on user inputs 
   - Used Pandas and openpyxl to access Excel mortality tables for calculations and logging results back to Excel

3. **Excel Life Insurance Pricing Model**  
   - VBA-based pricing calculator to automate calculations and log results across various scenarios.
   - Analyzed mortality rates and sensitivity factors (age, sex, and smoking) to explore their impact on life insurance pricing calculations
